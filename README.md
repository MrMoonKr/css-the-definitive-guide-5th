# CSS the Definitive Guide, 5th Edition

This repository contains the files used to create the figures for _CSS: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition_.  I mostly did this by loading them up in Firefox OS X and using the `:screenshot` console utility (see “[Firefox’s :screenshot command](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/08/24/firefoxs-screenshot-command-2018/)” for more information)—except in the rare cases where Firefox didn’t support the thing I was illustrating, in which case I used Chrome OS X set to somewhere around 200%–500% zoom.
