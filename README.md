# csstdg5figs [DRAFT]

This repository contains the files used to create the figures for _CSS: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition_.  I mostly did this by loading them up in Firefox OS X and using the `screenshot` command-line utility (see “[Essential Tool: Firefox’s screenshot Command](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2015/10/22/firefoxs-screenshot-command/)” for more information)—except in the rare cases where Firefox didn’t support the thing I was illustrating, in which case I used Chrome OS X set to somewhere around 200% zoom.

## Notes

* If you want an easy-to-browse method of access, load the repo-root-level `index.html` in a web browser and surf from there.  Also [available on GitHub Pages](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/).
